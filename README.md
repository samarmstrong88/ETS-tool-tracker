ETS-tool-tracker

A simple, React based application for pulling in unsorted API data from a REST service, and displaying jobs, with filters for job types. 

Original is senstive and  belongs to an organisation, and can't be posted on an unsecure application, so data was faked with a MongoDB 
instance and a simple Express server.

This project was originally built in pure React, but was updated to make use of Redux as a learning exercise.
